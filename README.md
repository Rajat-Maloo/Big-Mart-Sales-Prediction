# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
# Introduction:

The Big Mart Sales Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can  predict the sales of various products at Big Mart outlets. The project involves the analysis of historical sales data, identification of key features that influence sales, and the development of a regression model to predict sales based on these features. The project is implemented using Python and its various data analysis and machine learning libraries.

# Objectives:

The main objectives of the project are:

To analyze the historical sales data of Big Mart outlets and identify key features that influence sales.
To develop a regression model that can accurately predict sales based on these features.
To evaluate the performance of the model using various performance metrics and fine-tune the model to improve its performance.
To deploy the model as a web application to make it accessible to users.
# Data:

The project uses the Big Mart Sales dataset, which contains historical sales data for 1559 products across 10 Big Mart outlets. The dataset contains various features such as the product identifier, product weight, product visibility, product type, outlet identifier, outlet size, outlet type, and the sales of the product. The dataset is available on Kaggle and is used as the primary data source for the project.

# Methodology:

The project follows the following methodology:

Data preprocessing: The raw dataset is cleaned, and missing values and outliers are handled. Feature engineering is performed to create new features that may influence sales.

Data visualization: Data visualization is used to gain insights into the data and identify correlations between features and sales.

Model development: Various regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and XGBoost are developed and evaluated using cross-validation. The model with the best performance is selected.

Model deployment: The selected model is deployed as a web application using Flask. The web application allows users to enter the features of a product and obtain a sales prediction.

# Conclusion:

The Big Mart Sales Prediction project is an exciting machine learning project that aims to predict the sales of products at Big Mart outlets. The project involves various stages such as data preprocessing, data visualization, model development, and deployment. The project provides a valuable insight into the sales prediction problem and provides a practical solution that can be used by retailers to improve their sales forecasting.
